# X52 Elite Dangerous Mappings
This repo has the two files needed to setup the keybinds described in this video series (https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLbwEFrIX0iAi3Lh7_ozYTyatpI-JjIO3G) for the NON PRO version of the X52 HOTAS system.  The files linked in the descriptions of that video will only work with the X52 Pro.

The .pr0 is the mapping file for the joystick/throttle.  It needs to go into C:\Users\Public\Documents\SmartTechnology Profiles.  Once it's in that folder, it will be avilable in the context menu of the X52 software's system tray icon.

The .binds file needs to go to C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Local\Frontier Developments\Elite Dangerous\Options\Bindings.  The .binds file in the linked description will unbind all axis mappings for the joystick.
